# LSERT (Local Search Engine RusT)

** This is an experimental Technology **
** This is an unfinished project, This Code could break easily, The result might be Unexpected **
** File Ranking Algorithm also not finished yet, New File Ranking Algorithms Ideas are always welcome **

This Repository about creating Local Search Engine Using Rust

## Quick Start
```console
$ cargo run index ./folder -dp
$ cargo run serve 
```
## Supported Files for Analyze
** xml, xhtml, html, txt **

# New Ideas
### Server Side
    Share the files Locally (PC-Mobile), Share the files that connected to the same network using FTP
    Trying new Various Page Ranking Algorithms
    Colored Terminal View
    can get multiple folder paths
    Manually Unselect the file, you do not want to search
    Wrongly typed words must be noted and giving warnings
    Auto Completion Engine (Trie Algorithm)
    
### Client Side
    Provide file paths as a link (So Can Easily Go to the file)
    File Routing in Browser With Good UI (Easily can navigate inside the browser)
    Caching the Pages for Better Performance
